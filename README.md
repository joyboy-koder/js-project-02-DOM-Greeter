# DOM Greeter 👋🏽

A simple JavaScript project that demonstrates how to interact with the **DOM (Document Object Model)** to display dynamic content on a webpage.

In this mini project, users can type their name into an input field and click a button — instantly showing a personalized greeting message right on the page.  
It’s a step up from using alerts and prompts, moving toward real-time web interactivity.
